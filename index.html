        My name is Mark Meritt. I am a professor in game
        programming, app development and web development.
        I hope your first week at Humber this semester has 
        went well. In this course, WDDM 115, you will learn 
        about the tools and frameworks of web development.
        You will learn about how to create websites and 
        use repos, extensions within Visual Studio and managing 
        a project together. Good luck! 
        </p>
